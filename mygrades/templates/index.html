<h3>Attendance Policy:</h3>
<p>Because of our unique structure, there is no daily roll call. Gradable assignments are the Epic attendance record. Epic measures 100% attendance as 40 gradable assignments each nine weeks. It is important for families to understand that at the end of each of the four quarters, students must have an attendance of at least 76% to remain enrolled. One way to picture the relationship between gradable assignments and attendance could be described using the subject of Math. One gradable Math assignment at Epic might represent five days of work in a traditional brick and mortar classroom. All students with less than 76% attendance will be withdrawn at the end of each quarter. </p>
  <h3>What Is A Gradable Assignment?</h3>
  <p>Gradable Assignments (Attendance Points) are determined by your teacher.  You will know exactly what you need to complete on your Weekly Assignment List to receive credit for each assignment.  There are five possible Gradable Assignments (Attendance Points) each week.</p>
